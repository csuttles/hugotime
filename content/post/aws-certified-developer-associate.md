###### One More

Today I crushed the [AWS Certified Developer – Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/).

There's a lot of overlap between this exam and the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/), so I decided to make the most of my recent study efforts and go for a second AWS certification.

###### Preparation

I went through a lot of the same materials I used for the [exam I passed last week](http://blog.highspeedlogic.org/aws-solutions-architect-associate/). I used the course from ACloudGuru on Udemy that covers this test, and I spent more time working on DynamoDB, SQS, Lambda, and SNS. I did a few more quiklabs focusing on those areas, and also read through a couple whitepapers pointed out in the [AWS exam prep resource guide](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certification-prep/). I played around with Lambda a lot and also played with some of the AWS SDKs.

Other than that, I did similar things leading up to the exam day and on exam day as I did for the last exam.

###### Next Steps

My next steps in AWS will probably be either the [AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/) or the [AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/), depending on what I see from practice exams and my initial foray into preparation. Learning is fun!
