### Trifecta!

Last week, I passed the [AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/) exam. This is my third AWS associate level certification, and I am excited to finish the associate tier. This was the toughest associate level exam by far.

### Preparation

Like the other exams I took, I used LinuxAcademy and ACloudGuru content (purchased through Udemy). I also bought a Quiklabs subscription again; I canceled my previous one after a month, because it's a little pricy if you aren't using it actively. I basically did [all the same stuff I did to prepare for my first AWS certification](http://blog.highspeedlogic.org/aws-solutions-architect-associate/). Here's some things I did a little differently:

* I spent significantly more time studying Udemy/LinuxAcademy content
* I spent a lot more time doing labs and reading faqs and whitepapers
* I did a lot more practice exams from Udemy/LinuxAcademy 
* I took the AWS offical practice exam twice; both times I was close, but I failed
* I basically started at the top of this list and repeated until I knew the content very, very well
* I bought a reserved instance to keep cost down and get more practical experience building things in AWS under my own account
* I set up everything I could think of related to CloudWatch, then I investigated and set up things I hadn't thought about, because monitoring is huge on this test. Here's [a good video about using CloudWatch, keyed to a fun exercise about using CloudWatch to stream VPC Flow logs to ELK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaFaVeoA9V8&t=28m40s)
* Here's a great [playlist of AWS related videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd8CslE-o2wedj3baVATx_mgPtNke11t-)


### What's Next?

I'm looking forward to tackling the professional tier of AWS certifications, but I'm also planning on working on some other things before focusing on AWS certification again. AWS is a terrific platform, and it will be fun to just use it for a while.
