The first release of this book was pretty good. It improved the trajectory my career. That's a good book.

I have high hopes for the second edition. A lot has changed in Terraform and the DevOps landscape between the time I read the first edition and this release.

My code that corresponds to this book is here:

[https://bitbucket.org/csuttles/tf-uar2/src/master/](https://bitbucket.org/csuttles/tf-uar2/src/master/)  So far, I am only a couple of chapters in, but it's going well. The style is familiar. Hello world is still Hello world. I am excited to see some of the new sections as the book progresses.
